# Exercise 3
Learned how to use JS in a website and also how to make it responsive
The task is divided to 3 layouts:

## Layout 1 + 2
Learned how to position with relative and absolute and also how to make responsive design.

## Layout 3
In addition to the stuff I did with Layout 1+2, now I also need to integrate JS and make squares and change their color.

everytime I click +, another square appears with a random opacity.
When hovring on a square, it changes to white, and then changes back to it's original color.
